     I am an aspiring entreuprenuer. From day one, I have always loved to be my own boss or at least have the oppurtunity to reach a leadership position. During the 2020 pandemic, I fulfilled my entreuprenuerial dream of creating my own business. I created and ran my own baking company, Served by Carmella.
