  <p>
    I am an aspiring entreuprenuer. From day one, I have always loved to be my own boss or at least have the oppurtunity to reach a leadership position. During the 2020 pandemic, I fulfilled my entreuprenuerial dream of creating my own business. I created and ran my own baking company, Served by Carmella.

  After college, I am uncertain where I want to apply my schooling. I hope to work in the advertising industry within the Kansas City, Missouri area. This is where I am originally from and am a homebody. My best friends are my siblings and parents, who you will find me spending any free time with. 
</p>

<p> Feel free to check out my other commitments within and outside of school. </p>
